Action	Napoleon Hill	Do not wait: the time will never be 'just right'. Start where you stand, and work whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along.	2
Action	Tim Feriss	Ask yourself "What are you waiting for?" If you say "better timing" the answer is you are afraid. Measure the cost of inaction. Understand the unlikelihood of mistakes and missteps ruining your life and do what successful people do: Action	3
Action	Buddha	However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them?	4
Action	William James	Action seems to follow feeling but really action and feeling go together, and by regulating the action which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly  regulate the feeling, which  is not. So the voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there	5
Action	Confucius	A superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions	6
Action	Lao Tzu	Great acts are made up of small deeds. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step	7

Action	Johann Wolfgang von Goethe	Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one's thoughts into action is the most difficult thing in the world	13
Action	Stephen Covey	Begin with the end in mind. If you know your destination, you can better understand where you are now. And then you can make the decision to get yourself moving forward in the right direction	14
Action	Stephen Covey	Write down the result you desire. Then write down the actions that will get you to that result. Then do those things	15

Action	Paulo Coelho	There is only one way to learn. It's through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey.	18
Action	Tony Robbins	A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken a new action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided. You see, in life, lots of people know what to do, but few people actually do what they know. Knowing is not enough! You must take action.	19
Action	Theodore Roosevelt	Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.	20
Action	Tony Robbins	In essence, if we want to direct our lives, we must take control of our habits. It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently	21

Action	Andrew Carnegie	Do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself	26
Action	Peter Drucker	Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action	27
Action	Tony Robbins	Most people have no idea of the giant capacity we can immediately command when we focus all of our resources on mastering a single area of our lives	28
Action	Tony Robbins	One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular	29
Action	Tony Robbins	The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies, and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviors	30
Action	Jim Rohn	It doesn't matter which side of the fence you get off on sometimes. What matters most is getting off. You cannot make progress without making decisions.	31

Anger	Buddha	You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger	34
Anger	Medgar Evans	When you hate, the only one that suffers is you. Because most of the people you hate don't know it and the rest don't care	35
Anger	Epictus	In the long run, every man will pay the penalty for his own misdeeds. He will reap what he sowed. She will reap what she sowed. The man who remembers this will be angry with no one, offend no one, hate no one, vilify no one	36
Anger	Aristotle	Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way, that is not within everybody's power and is not easy	37

Anger	Harold and Kumar	Look at me. I'm fat, black, can't dance, and I have two gay fathers. People have been messing with me my whole life. I learned a long time ago there's no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time. In the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should	40
Anger	Laurence Jones	I have no time to quarrel, no time for regrets and no man can force me to stoop low enough to hate him. Can't you see I'm busy trying to educate the poor?	33
Appreciation	Pastor Joel Osteen	It's good to have goals and dreams, but while you're waiting for things to change, waiting for promises to come to pass, don't be discontent with where you are. Learn to enjoy the season that you're in	41
Appreciation	Alexandre Dumas	"Those born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying every wish, know not what is the real happiness of life, just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather."-  The Count of Monte Cristo	42
Appreciation	Alexandre Dumas	"This piece of iron which he had been allowed to keep aroused a more profound wave of gratitude towards Heaven in his heart than the greatest blessings that he experienced in his life outside of prison" - The Count of Monte Cristo, describing Edmond Dantes when he luckily finds a piece of iron to dig a hole out of his prison	43

Appreciation	Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe	Go to foreign countries and you will get to know the good things one possesses at home	47
Career	Steve jobs	When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.	48
Career	Albert Einstein	Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid.	49
Career	Steve jobs	I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.	50
Career	Confucius	Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life	51
Career	Thomas Edison	I never did a day's work in my life. It was all fun	52
Career	Steve Jobs	You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it's humorous, all the attention to it, because it's hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that's happened to me	53
Career	Paulo Coelho	I was not encouraged to follow the career of a writer because my parents thought that I was going to starve to death. They thought nobody can make a living from being a writer in Brazil. They were not wrong.	54
Career	Steve Jobs	You've got to find what you love. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.	55
Career	Unknown	I'd rather be at the bottom of a ladder I want to be on than halfway up a ladder I don't want to be on	56
Comedy	Charlie Chaplin	To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with it!	57
Comedy	Bill Hicks	The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round; it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun... for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, and they say, "Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid -EVER- because, this is just a ride." And we... KILL those people HAHAHA! "Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride - SHUT HIM UP! Look at my furrows of worry! Look at my big bank account, and my family! This just HAS to be real!"... But it's just a ride. And we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok? Jesus - murdered; Martin Luther King - murdered; Malcolm X - murdered; Gandhi - murdered; John Lennon - murdered; Reagan... wounded HAHA! But it doesn't matter because: It's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. A choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride: Take all that money that we spend on weapons and defense each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would many times over, NOT ONE HUMAN BEING EXCLUDED, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.	58
Comedy	Mark Twain	The secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven	59
Comedy	Russell Peters	Comedy is like boxing. All those little Open Mics are just little fighters that you're fighting along the way to get to the title	60
Comedy	Unknown	That which is most personal is most general. The more authentic you become, the more genuine in your expression, particularly regarding personal experiences and even self-doubts, the more people can relate to your expression and the safer it makes them feel to express themselves.	61
Comedy	Chris Rock	It's extraordinary to me when you get a laugh. That you can go in front of a bunch of people you never met before, you can say some stuff and they all laugh in unison - that's amazing. It's a miracle	62
Comedy	Jim Carrey	If I had never ventured beyond being a stand-up comic, then I would be sitting in my house today working on my Leonardo DiCaprio impression	63
Comedy	Bill Hicks	Occasionally, people get upset because they don't think it's funny. Somebody asked me "Bill why can't you do things that appeal to everybody?" ?? well that's impossible! What a burden! I will please all people! No one's done that yet. What am I supposed to do, change my beliefs and attitude for them? To be what to them?	64
Comedy	Bill Hicks	I honestly believe we are all the same. It's condescending to say "I will give them what THEY want". "You are all a bunch of idiots so I will do things I don't believe in to amuse you"	65
Comedy	Sidonie Gabrielle	"Sit down and put down everything that comes into your head and then you're a writer. But an author is one who can judge his own stuff's worth, without pity, and destroy most of it."	66
Comedy	Mahatma Gandhi	If I had no sense of humor, I would long ago have committed suicide	67

Compassion	Buddha	Whatever words we utter should be chosen with care for people will hear them and be influenced by them for good or ill	77
Compassion	Lao Tzu	The wise man does not lay up his own treasures. The more he gives to others, the more he has for his own.	78
Compassion	Dale Carnegie	The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition	79
Compassion	Stephen Covey	Look at the weaknesses of others with compassion, not accusation. It's not what they're not doing or should be doing that's the issue. The issue is your own chosen response to the situation	80

Compassion	Mahatma Gandhi	The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others	82
Compassion	William Arthur Ward	"A warm smile is the universal language of kindness."	83

Compassion	Martin Luther King, Jr.	I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality	87
Confidence	Will Smith	Don't let anybody tell you, you can't do something. Not even your parents or family. You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you "you can't do it". If you want something, go get it, PERIOD.	88
Confidence	Walt Disney	If you can dream it, you can do it.	89
Confidence	Unknown	Never be bothered by what people say as long as you know in your heart you are right	90
Confidence	David J. Schwartz	Lack of self-confidence is due to mismanaged memory	91
Confidence	David J. Schwartz	Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.	92

Confidence	Mark Twain	A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval	110
Confidence	Apple	"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do"	111

Courage & Fear	Muhammad Ali	He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life	114

Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition	132

Destiny	Dalai Lama	Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck	143
Destiny	Brian Tracy	You are the architect of your own destiny; you are the master of your own fate; you are behind the steering wheel of your life. There are no limitations to what you can do, what you can have or who you can be. Except the limitations you place on yourself by your own thinking	144

Destiny	Steve Jobs	I was a college drop-out, my biological parents didn't love me, had no money in my early 20s. I just followed where my natural curiosity and instincts led me. I had no idea why certain things were happening in my life. But you cannot connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect the dots looking backwards.

This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life	149

Destiny	Johann Wolfgang von Goethe	The person born with a talent they are meant to use will find their greatest happiness in using it	152
Destiny	Marilyn Monroe	I believe that everything happens for a reason.

Destiny	Unknown	I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday	154
Destiny	Unknown	If you have a fucked-up map, every step you take will get you to the wrong place faster	155

Destiny	Tony Robbins	I challenge you to make your life a masterpiece. I challenge you to join the ranks of those people who live what they teach, who walk their talk	157
Destiny	Martin Luther King, Jr.	Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted	158
Destiny	Erich Fromm	"If other people do not understand our behavior?so what? Their request that we must only do what they understand is an attempt to control us. If this is being "asocial" or "irrational" in their eyes, so be it. Mostly they resent our freedom and our courage to be ourselves. We owe nobody an explanation, as long as our acts do not hurt or infringe on them. How many lives have been ruined by this need to "explain," which usually implies that the explanation be "understood," i.e. approved. Let your deeds be judged, and from your deeds, your real intentions, but know that a free person owes an explanation only to himself?to his reason and his conscience?and to the few who may have a justified claim for explanation."	159
Destiny	Robert Kennedy	Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.	160
Destiny	Unknown	진정한 선비는 절대로 그릇된 군주나 사상을 위해 재능을 쓰지 않는다. 세상을 바꿀 재능을 시골구석에 숨어야 하더라도 때를 기다리고 그때서야 일어나 대의를 위해 헌신한다. 	161

Discipline	Dale Carnegie	In his fascinating book, Alone, Admiral Richard E. Byrd told about the time he spent in bewildering and soul-shattering darkness. He lived alone in a shack that was literally buried in the great glacial icecap that covers the South Pole. He spent five months there. The days were as black as the nights. No living creature of any kind existed within a hundred miles. The cold was so intense that he could hear his breath freeze and crystallize as the wind blew it past his ears. "At night, before blowing out the lantern, I formed the habit of planning the morrow's work." He had to, in order to preserve his sanity. "It was wonderful to be able to dole out time in this way.

Education & Learning	George Carlin	Children should be taught to question everything they read and hear. They should be taught to question authority. Parents and teachers don't want to teach kids to question authority because they themselves are authority figures.

I'm pretty sure none of Pixar or the most creative things I've accomplished in life would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.	220

Therefore, in order to be the superior of the people / One must, in the use of words, place himself below them. And in order to be ahead of the people, one must, in one's own person, follow them.

I drift like the waves of the sea. Without direction, like the restless wind. But I am nourished by the great Mother.	513

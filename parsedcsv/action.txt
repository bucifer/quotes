Action seems to follow feeling but really action and feeling go together, and by regulating the action which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly  regulate the feeling, which  is not.

Paulo Coelho
A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken a new action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided. You see, in life, lots of people know what to do, but few people actually do what they know. Knowing is not enough! You must take action.
Tony Robbins
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

Tony Robbins
The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies, and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviors

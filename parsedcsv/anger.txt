Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned
Buddha
I have no time to quarrel, no time for regrets and no man can force me to stoop low enough to hate him. Can¡¯t you see I¡¯m busy trying to educate the poor?

Buddha
When you hate, the only one that suffers is you. Because most of the people you hate don't know it and the rest don't care

Mark Twain
I shall allow no man to belittle my soul by making me hate him 
Booker T. Washington
Look at me. I'm fat, black, can't dance, and I have two gay fathers. People have been messing with me my whole life. I learned a long time ago there's no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time. In the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should

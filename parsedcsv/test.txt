Appreciation 
It's good to have goals and dreams, but while you're waiting for things to change, waiting for promises to come to pass, don't be discontent with where you are. Learn to enjoy the season that you're in
Pastor Joel Osteen
"Those born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying every wish, know not what is the real happiness of life, just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather."-  The Count of Monte Cristo
Alexandre Dumas
"This piece of iron which he had been allowed to keep aroused a more profound wave of gratitude towards Heaven in his heart than the greatest blessings that he experienced in his life outside of prison" - The Count of Monte Cristo, describing Edmond Dantes when he luckily finds a piece of iron to dig a hole out of his prison 
Alexandre Dumas
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is mystery. But today is a gift. That's why we call it the Present
Master Oogway 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it  
William Arthur Ward
I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see
John Burroughs
Go to foreign countries and you will get to know the good things one possesses at home 
Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

Career
When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid. 
Albert Einstein 
I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life
Confucius 
I never did a day's work in my life. It was all fun
Thomas Edison 
You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it's humorous, all the attention to it, because it's hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that's happened to me
Steve Jobs
I was not encouraged to follow the career of a writer because my parents thought that I was going to starve to death. They thought nobody can make a living from being a writer in Brazil. They were not wrong.  
Paulo Coelho 
You've got to find what you love. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.
Steve Jobs
I'd rather be at the bottom of a ladder I want to be on than halfway up a ladder I don't want to be on

Comedy 
To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with it!
Charlie Chaplin
The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round; it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun... for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, and they say, "Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid -EVER- because, this is just a ride." And we... KILL those people HAHAHA! "Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride - SHUT HIM UP! Look at my furrows of worry! Look at my big bank account, and my family! This just HAS to be real!"... But it's just a ride. And we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok? Jesus - murdered; Martin Luther King - murdered; Malcolm X - murdered; Gandhi - murdered; John Lennon - murdered; Reagan... wounded HAHA! But it doesn't matter because: It's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. A choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride: Take all that money that we spend on weapons and defense each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would many times over, NOT ONE HUMAN BEING EXCLUDED, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.
Bill Hicks
The secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven
Mark Twain
Comedy is like boxing. All those little Open Mics are just little fighters that you're fighting along the way to get to the title
Russell Peters 
That which is most personal is most general. The more authentic you become, the more genuine in your expression, particularly regarding personal experiences and even self-doubts, the more people can relate to your expression and the safer it makes them feel to express themselves.

It's extraordinary to me when you get a laugh. That you can go in front of a bunch of people you never met before, you can say some stuff and they all laugh in unison - that's amazing. It's a miracle 
Chris Rock 
If I had never ventured beyond being a stand-up comic, then I would be sitting in my house today working on my Leonardo DiCaprio impression
Jim Carrey
Occasionally, people get upset because they don't think it's funny. Somebody asked me "Bill why can't you do things that appeal to everybody?" ¡¦ well that's impossible! What a burden! I will please all people! No one's done that yet. What am I supposed to do, change my beliefs and attitude for them? To be what to them?
Bill Hicks
I honestly believe we are all the same. It's condescending to say "I will give them what THEY want". "You are all a bunch of idiots so I will do things I don't believe in to amuse you"
Bill Hicks
"Sit down and put down everything that comes into your head and then you're a writer. But an author is one who can judge his own stuff's worth, without pity, and destroy most of it." 
Sidonie Gabrielle
If I had no sense of humor, I would long ago have committed suicide
Mahatma Gandhi

Compassion 
Whoever renders service to many puts himself in line for greatness - great wealth, great return, great satisfaction, great reputation, and great joy
Jim Rohn
You cannot judge any man beyond your knowledge of him, and how small is your knowledge
Kahlil Gibran
"We can never judge the lives of others, because each person knows only their own pain. It's one thing to feel that you are on the right path, but it's another to think that yours is the only path"
Paulo Coelho 
God Himself, sir, does not propose to judge a man until his life is over.  Why should you and I?
Samuel Johnson

William Penn
If you would take, you must first give, this is the beginning of intelligence 
Lao Tzu
"Kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless." 
Mother Teresa
Whatever words we utter should be chosen with care for people will hear them and be influenced by them for good or ill
Buddha 
The wise man does not lay up his own treasures. The more he gives to others, the more he has for his own.
Lao Tzu
The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition
Dale Carnegie 
Look at the weaknesses of others with compassion, not accusation. It's not what they're not doing or should be doing that's the issue. The issue is your own chosen response to the situation
Stephen Covey 
No reason is needed for loving.
Paulo Coelho 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others 
Mahatma Gandhi

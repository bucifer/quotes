Confidence 
Don't let anybody tell you, you can't do something. Not even your parents or family. You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you "you can't do it". If you want something, go get it, PERIOD.

 "Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do"

Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
Margaret Mead
I was a college drop-out, my biological parents didn't love me, had no money in my early 20s. I just followed where my natural curiosity and instincts led me. I had no idea why certain things were happening in my life. But you cannot connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect the dots looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something ? your gut, destiny, God, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life
Steve Jobs
There are no accidents  
Master Oogway 
If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary 
Jim Rohn
The person born with a talent they are meant to use will find their greatest happiness in using it
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes, good things fall apart so better things can fall together."

Tony Robbins
Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted
Martin Luther King Jr.
 "If other people do not understand our behavior?so what? Their request that we must only do what they understand is an attempt to control us. If this is being "asocial" or "irrational" in their eyes, so be it. Mostly they resent our freedom and our courage to be ourselves. We owe nobody an explanation, as long as our acts do not hurt or infringe on them. How many lives have been ruined by this need to "explain," which usually implies that the explanation be "understood," i.e. approved. Let your deeds be judged, and from your deeds, your real intentions, but know that a free person owes an explanation only to himself?to his reason and his conscience?and to the few who may have a justified claim for explanation." 
Erich Fromm
Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.

Discipline 
Begin today to practice self-discipline in every area of your life. Persist in this practice until self-discipline comes to you automatically. You make yourself into a better, stronger person by persisting every time you feel like quitting.

When you gain strong self-discipline, you will become unstoppable in your life

Before you know it, you have the Great wall.

In his fascinating book, Alone, Admiral Richard E. Byrd told about the time he spent in bewildering and soul-shattering darkness. He lived alone in a shack that was literally buried in the great glacial icecap that covers the South Pole. He spent five months there. The days were as black as the nights. No living creature of any kind existed within a hundred miles. The cold was so intense that he could hear his breath freeze and crystallize as the wind blew it past his ears. "At night, before blowing out the lantern, I formed the habit of planning the morrow's work." He had to, in order to preserve his sanity. "It was wonderful to be able to dole out time in this way. It brought me an extraordinary sense of command over myself; and without constant activity, the days would have been without purpose; and without purpose, they would have ended ? as such days always end ? in disintegration."
Dale Carnegie

Mark Twain
School, I never truly got the knack of. I could never focus on things I didn't want to learn 
Leonardo DiCaprio
Respect and Obedience should not be automatic. They should be earned 
George Carlin
We believe in stupid things because we are pounded ideas as children. Kids are too young to argue against ideas from adults. Up to a certain age, kids believe everything grown-ups tell them. EVERYTHING. So they don't learn how to question things. They become adults, they still don't question things 
George Carlin
Children should be taught to question everything they read and hear. They should be taught to question authority. Parents and teachers don't want to teach kids to question authority because they themselves are authority figures. So they don't want to undermine their own bullshit inside the household and classrooms. So they stroke the kid, the kid strokes them, they all stroke each other and they all grow up fucked up and come to shows like this

Success is 99 percent failure 
 Soichiro Honda
"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter into one of the most creative periods of my life. I'm pretty sure none of Pixar or the most creative things I've accomplished in life would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith" 
Steve Jobs

Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm
Winston Churchill
There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid them. But it's better to lose in the struggles for your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're fighting for
Paulo Coelho
Failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy to finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one area where I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter, and a big idea. And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
 J. K. Rowling

That is why they can be their kings. Therefore, in order to be the superior of the people / One must, in the use of words, place himself below them. And in order to be ahead of the people, one must, in one's own person, follow them. Therefore the sage places himself above the people and they do not feel his weight. He places himself in front of them and the people do not harm him. Therefore the world rejoices in praising him without getting tired of it. It is precisely because he does not compete, that the world cannot compete with him.
Lao Tzu 
Know that you possess the strong, masculine principle but abide by the meek, feminine principle. The one who does not contend with others flows with nature like water 
Lao Tzu 
Reveal your weaknesses, loudly admit your weaknesses and be intentionally vulnerable. Don't try to be strong, intelligent and superior. Gladly act weak and foolish 
Unknown
Reveal your weaknesses in front of others but hold your true weakness secretly.

"Accomplish but do not boast, accomplish without show, accomplish without arrogance, accomplish without grabbing, accomplish without forcing"
Lao Tzu
When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.
Lao Tzu
"Boasting of wealth and virtue brings your demise" 
Lao Tzu
I am struck by how sharing our weakness and difficulties is more nourishing to others than sharing our qualities and successes.
Jean Vanier
The higher the sun arises, the less shadow he casts;  the greater the goodness, the less it covets praise; yet it cannot avoid its rewards in honours 
 Lao Tzu
Weak dogs bark the loudest 
Asian Proverb 
In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water. Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it
Lao Tzu
The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world 
Lao Tzu
My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. (2 Cor. 12:9-10)
Bible
 "To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some"  - Corinthians 9:22
Bible
I think what kind of person you are during success is who you are. It's easy to be nice in failure and when you're broke - then you really need a lot of help from people. But after you win some money, that's the person you really are, because now you can be mean to people. You can act like an asshole. I've seen people trip out again and again. A lot of times this behavior, when you're up, will determine if you get another shot someday, because things in this business always go down. I want them to say, "He was a nice guy during the whole process. He never did the entourage thing." Because that ain't funny. It's annoying

Arnold Schwarzenegger

Dale Carnegie
The last three or four reps is what makes the muscle grow. This area of pain divides the champion from someone else who is not a champion. That's what most people lack, having the guts to go on and just say they'll go through the pain no matter what happens
Arnold Schwarzenegger
"Almost all the benefit of the exercise comes at the very end. I'm trying to build strength. And that doesn't happen until the muscle fiber ruptures and the nerve fiber registers the pain. Then nature overcompensates and within 48 hours, the fiber is made stronger"

Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.

Jim Carrey
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you down to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody's gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you!

He gets down to the end of his life, and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered, Those were the best years of his life, 'cause they made him who he was. All those years he was happy? You know, total waste. Didn't learn a thing. So, if you sleep until you're 18... Ah, think of the suffering you're gonna miss. I mean high school?

Napoleon Hill
 "Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit." 
Napoleon Hill
"Before success comes in any man's life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit. That is exactly what the majority of men do. More than five hundred of the most successful men this country has ever known told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them."

 "If you want to reach a state of bliss, then go beyond your ego and the internal dialogue. Make a decision to relinquish the need to control, the need to be approved, and the need to judge. Those are the three things the ego is doing all the time. It's very important to be aware of them every time they come up" 
Deepak Chopra 
"Don't think about what you've left behind" The alchemist said to the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. "If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil.

Being realistic is the mostly commonly traveled road to mediocrity. What's the point of being realistic?

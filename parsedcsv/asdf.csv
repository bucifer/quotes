Career	Steve jobs	When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.

Comedy	Bill Hicks	The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round; it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun... for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, and they say, "Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid -EVER- because, this is just a ride." And we... KILL those people HAHAHA! "Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride - SHUT HIM UP! Look at my furrows of worry! Look at my big bank account, and my family! This just HAS to be real!"... But it's just a ride. And we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok? Jesus - murdered; Martin Luther King - murdered; Malcolm X - murdered; Gandhi - murdered; John Lennon - murdered; Reagan... wounded HAHA! But it doesn't matter because: It's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. A choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride: Take all that money that we spend on weapons and defense each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would many times over, NOT ONE HUMAN BEING EXCLUDED, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.

Destiny	Steve Jobs	I was a college drop-out, my biological parents didn't love me, had no money in my early 20s. I just followed where my natural curiosity and instincts led me. I had no idea why certain things were happening in my life. But you cannot connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect the dots looking backwards.

Destiny	Erich Fromm	"If other people do not understand our behavior?so what? Their request that we must only do what they understand is an attempt to control us. If this is being "asocial" or "irrational" in their eyes, so be it. Mostly they resent our freedom and our courage to be ourselves. We owe nobody an explanation, as long as our acts do not hurt or infringe on them. How many lives have been ruined by this need to "explain," which usually implies that the explanation be "understood," i.e. approved. Let your deeds be judged, and from your deeds, your real intentions, but know that a free person owes an explanation only to himself?to his reason and his conscience?and to the few who may have a justified claim for explanation."
Destiny	Robert Kennedy	Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.

Discipline	Dale Carnegie	In his fascinating book, Alone, Admiral Richard E. Byrd told about the time he spent in bewildering and soul-shattering darkness. He lived alone in a shack that was literally buried in the great glacial icecap that covers the South Pole. He spent five months there. The days were as black as the nights. No living creature of any kind existed within a hundred miles. The cold was so intense that he could hear his breath freeze and crystallize as the wind blew it past his ears. "At night, before blowing out the lantern, I formed the habit of planning the morrow's work." He had to, in order to preserve his sanity. "It was wonderful to be able to dole out time in this way. It brought me an extraordinary sense of command over myself; and without constant activity, the days would have been without purpose; and without purpose, they would have ended ? as such days always end ? in disintegration."

Education & Learning	George Carlin	Respect and Obedience should not be automatic. They should be earned
Education & Learning	George Carlin	We believe in stupid things because we are pounded ideas as children. Kids are too young to argue against ideas from adults. Up to a certain age, kids believe everything grown-ups tell them. EVERYTHING. So they don't learn how to question things. They become adults, they still don't question things
Education & Learning	George Carlin	Children should be taught to question everything they read and hear. They should be taught to question authority. Parents and teachers don't want to teach kids to question authority because they themselves are authority figures. So they don't want to undermine their own bullshit inside the household and classrooms. So they stroke the kid, the kid strokes them, they all stroke each other and they all grow up fucked up and come to shows like this

I'm pretty sure none of Pixar or the most creative things I've accomplished in life would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith"

Failure	J. K. Rowling	Failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy to finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one area where I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter, and a big idea. And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

Modesty	Lao Tzu 	The great rivers and seas are kings of all mountain streams because they skillfully stay below them. That is why they can be their kings. Therefore, in order to be the superior of the people / One must, in the use of words, place himself below them. And in order to be ahead of the people, one must, in one's own person, follow them. Therefore the sage places himself above the people and they do not feel his weight. He places himself in front of them and the people do not harm him. Therefore the world rejoices in praising him without getting tired of it. It is?precisely?because he does not compete, that the world cannot compete with him.

Modesty	Chris Rock	I think what kind of person you are during success is who you are. It's easy to be nice in failure and when you're broke - then you really need a lot of help from people. But after you win some money, that's the person you really are, because now you can be mean to people. You can act like an asshole. I've seen people trip out again and again. A lot of times this behavior, when you're up, will determine if you get another shot someday, because things in this business always go down. I want them to say, "He was a nice guy during the whole process. He never did the entourage thing." Because that ain't funny. It's annoying
